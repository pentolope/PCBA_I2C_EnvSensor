# PCBA_I2C_EnvSensor — I²C Environmental Sensor Pod

## Mission

A compact 3.3 V I²C sensor pod for temperature, humidity, pressure and ambient light on a 4-pin 3V3/GND/SDA/SCL host connector.

This repository holds the design problem for a compact 3.3 V I²C environmental sensor pod that measures temperature, humidity, pressure and ambient light and connects to a host through a 4-pin connector carrying 3V3, GND, SDA and SCL. The brief fixes the measurands, the supply rail, the bus type, the connector pin count and signal set, the need for address-selection or isolation where needed so the sensors can coexist, two placement constraints (heat-generating parts away from the temperature/humidity sensor, sensing elements reasonably exposed to ambient air), and it sets a low-cost two-layer assembly from readily available parts as the target. Everything else is open: no sensor parts, connector part, footprint or mating style, pull-up values, bus speed, current budget, board outline, stackup detail, protection scheme or test strategy is named. This is a detail-2 brief, so most of the architecture and all component selection belong to the design agent, which must make and document those choices rather than treat them as pre-decided.

This repository is board **2 of 32** in the `PCBA_AutoDesignAndTest`
benchmark. The suite is catalogued in
[pentolope/PCBA_AutoDesignAndTest_Bench](https://github.com/pentolope/PCBA_AutoDesignAndTest_Bench).

This is a difficulty 1/5 board with a sparse brief (detail 2/5), which tests whether an agent can produce a clean, buildable two-layer sensor design without inventing requirements the brief never stated. The named stressors — sensor placement, I2C pullups, low-power and connector/pinout — are exactly the four places where a plausible-sounding but unsubstantiated answer is easy to write: thermal and airflow separation for the temp/humidity element, a pull-up value justified by an actual bus-capacitance and rise-time budget, current draw claimed against a real datasheet, and a connector choice that is argued rather than copied from a familiar 4-pin ecosystem. It also checks discipline about multi-device I²C addressing, since the brief requires the sensors to coexist but names no devices and no addresses.

## Status: not designed

There is no schematic, no board, no netlist and no part selection in this
repository, and their absence is the current, correct state — not an omission to
be tidied away. What exists is the brief, the reading of the brief, and the
scaffolding a design run needs.

Nothing here should be read as a design decision already taken. See
[docs/status.md](docs/status.md).

## `BRIEF.md` is the requirement

[BRIEF.md](BRIEF.md) is supplied by the benchmark and is authoritative. It is
preserved byte for byte and **is not edited** — not to clarify it, not to record
a decision, not to fix a typo. A design run reads it and writes elsewhere.

## Do not fabricate requirements

This is the rule the benchmark exists to test, and the one most easily broken by
being helpful.

> Missing details are design freedom, not permission to fabricate unstated user
> requirements.

Where the brief is silent, **you** choose — and you record it as your choice, in
[board/requirements.md](board/requirements.md) under the open decision it
answers, with the reasoning that made it. What you must not do is write the
choice down as though the user had asked for it. A part number, a dimension, a
voltage or a layer count that appears in this repository as a *requirement* must
be traceable to a sentence in `BRIEF.md`; anything else is a *decision*, and the
two are never allowed to blur.

[board/requirements.json](board/requirements.json) holds that split in machine
-readable form: `fixed_requirements` each carry the verbatim brief text that
substantiates them, `open_decisions` are the choices still yours to make. Adding
to `fixed_requirements` without brief evidence is the failure mode, not a
shortcut.

## Authority and safety

1. Native KiCad `.kicad_sch`, `.kicad_pcb`, `.kicad_pro` and `.kicad_dru` files
   are the final design authority once they exist. A committed board is
   authoritative as committed.
2. A generator may produce the board, but a generated board is a **candidate**
   that must pass every gate before it replaces a committed one. A generator is
   not a second design authority.
3. Use KiCad Routing Tools only, to propose tracks and permitted new routing
   vias. It is a submodule of the toolkit, pinned to a commit on its
   `pcba-autonomy` branch and resolved through `pcbqa.krt`; no sibling checkout
   and no absolute path.
4. Never overwrite a source board while generating or importing a route. Route
   only into fresh candidate paths.
5. Automated tools must not move, remove, resize, redrill, re-layer, retype or
   reassign a pre-existing via. A needed change is made in the authoritative
   input and the candidate regenerated.
6. Do not run a cleanup, smoothing, repair, merge or optimisation pass that
   silently rewrites routed copper.
7. Do not weaken a check, add a waiver, suppress a finding, or change an expected
   result merely to make a test pass. A waiver is bound to exact objects and
   digests, and carries a reason.
8. Do not commit, push, create a pull request, change a remote, or update the
   toolkit submodule pointer without explicit user authorisation.
9. **Never submit an order.** JLCPCB Gerber and placement previews require human
   approval. A local release is a candidate, not an order.

## Repository boundary

Owned here:

- the brief and the reading of it — `BRIEF.md`, `board/requirements.*`
- the board itself, once designed: native KiCad files, project libraries, the
  generator chain, and checks genuinely specific to this board
- `board/` — manifest, toolchain paths, selected fabrication options
- board documentation and, once promoted, release outputs

Owned by the toolkit at `tooling/PCBA_AutoDesignAndTest`, and not to be restated
or relaxed here:

- gate implementations, rule types, measurement definitions
- JLCPCB-wide capability and process limits
- the clean-room release lifecycle, publication and coherence

Dependencies run one way. The toolkit knows nothing about this board, and
nothing board-specific may be pushed into it to make this board pass. If a rule
type genuinely cannot express what this board needs, that is a toolkit gap worth
reporting — not a reason to special-case a board name inside `pcbqa/`.

## What must not be committed

Routing search output, candidate pools, build trees, validator attempt
directories and openEMS field dumps are disposable by construction and are
ignored by [.gitignore](.gitignore). They are regenerated from what *is*
committed. A release package is committed only when a human promotes it, and
then as exact bytes — see [.gitattributes](.gitattributes).

Thirty-two repositories share one benchmark clone. Weight here is paid
thirty-two times.

## Toolkit consumption

The toolkit is used **only** from `tooling/PCBA_AutoDesignAndTest`, pinned to a
commit that exists on its remote. `PCB_TOOLKIT_PATH` exists to test against a
local toolkit checkout before a submodule bump is committed — it is a
development affordance, and nothing committed here may depend on it.

A fresh recursive clone must work with no manual setup beyond checking out
submodules.

## Publishing discipline

Before any push of design-cycle work, run `/claim-audit` on the drafted commit
message and report — every claim-bearing word binds to an artefact recomputed on
the spot, never to the process that produced it — and then
`/accountability-review`, which asks whether the work did what was asked, from a
context that does not share this session's account of what was asked.

For a board at this stage the audit is short and the discipline is not: the
honest claim about an undesigned board is that it is undesigned.

## Running

Ubuntu, and the system Python 3. KiCad is the distribution package, so `pcbnew`
imports from `/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages` and `kicad-cli` is on PATH.

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

```bash
python3 tooling/PCBA_AutoDesignAndTest/run.py preflight
```

Once a board and a manifest exist — `board/manifest.template.json` is the
starting point, and becomes `board/manifest.json` when it points at real files:

```bash
python3 tooling/PCBA_AutoDesignAndTest/run.py validate board/manifest.json
```

Every gate whose policy block is absent reports `NOT_APPLICABLE` **with a
reason** and still appears in the matrix. Absence is never a silent pass, so the
first run tells you exactly what this board has not yet opted into. See
[the toolkit's onboarding guide](tooling/PCBA_AutoDesignAndTest/examples/onboarding.md).
